        A magical integer m is such that the remainder of the division of any
        prime number p by m is either a prime number or 1. What is the unique 
        magical integer between 25 and 100? And is there any less than 25?

    It is quite easy to actually prove by hand that 4,6,8,12,18,24,30 are the only magical numbers up to 30. That there are no more magical numbers follows from Dirichlet's theorem and the fact, if p1, p2, ..., pn are the first n primes, that p{n+1}^2 < p1 p2 ... pn for n >= 4 !
